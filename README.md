# To know when a vendor file is ready for download from the vendorâ€™s location to your system, you can use one of the following mechanisms depending on how the vendor provides file availability notifications:

## ðŸ”¹ Approach 1: Polling Mechanism (Scheduled Check)
If the vendor does not provide any event notification, you can periodically check if the file is available at their location.

âœ… Steps
Schedule a job in Spring Boot that checks for new files at regular intervals.
If the file exists, download it.
ðŸ“Œ Implementation (Using SFTP)

import com.jcraft.jsch.ChannelSftp;
import com.jcraft.jsch.JSch;
import com.jcraft.jsch.Session;
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Scheduled;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.util.Properties;

@Service
public class VendorFileDownloader {

    private static final String SFTP_HOST = "vendor.sftp.com";
    private static final int SFTP_PORT = 22;
    private static final String SFTP_USER = "username";
    private static final String SFTP_PASSWORD = "password";
    private static final String VENDOR_DIRECTORY = "/vendor/files/";
    private static final String LOCAL_DIRECTORY = "/local/vendor/files/";

    @Scheduled(fixedRate = 60000) // Runs every 60 seconds
    public void checkAndDownloadFiles() {
        try {
            JSch jsch = new JSch();
            Session session = jsch.getSession(SFTP_USER, SFTP_HOST, SFTP_PORT);
            session.setPassword(SFTP_PASSWORD);

            Properties config = new Properties();
            config.put("StrictHostKeyChecking", "no");
            session.setConfig(config);
            session.connect();

            ChannelSftp channelSftp = (ChannelSftp) session.openChannel("sftp");
            channelSftp.connect();

            channelSftp.cd(VENDOR_DIRECTORY);
            for (Object obj : channelSftp.ls(VENDOR_DIRECTORY)) {
                ChannelSftp.LsEntry entry = (ChannelSftp.LsEntry) obj;
                String fileName = entry.getFilename();

                if (!fileName.equals(".") && !fileName.equals("..")) {
                    System.out.println("Downloading file: " + fileName);
                    try (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(new File(LOCAL_DIRECTORY + fileName))) {
                        channelSftp.get(fileName, fos);
                    }
                    System.out.println("File downloaded: " + fileName);
                }
            }

            channelSftp.disconnect();
            session.disconnect();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
ðŸ”¹ Why Use This?
âœ… Works for SFTP, FTP, and cloud storage
âœ… Simple to implement
âœ… Good if the vendor does not provide real-time notifications

## ðŸ”¹ Approach 2: Vendor Sends an Event Notification (Best for APIs or Webhooks)
If the vendor provides an API or webhook notification, you can configure a listener to receive a message when the file is ready.

âœ… Steps
Vendor sends an API call/webhook when the file is ready.
Your Spring Boot application receives the event and downloads the file.
ðŸ“Œ Implementation (Webhook Listener for File Ready Event)


import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/vendor")
public class VendorFileWebhookController {

    @PostMapping("/file-ready")
    public String handleVendorFileReady(@RequestBody VendorFileEvent event) {
        System.out.println("File ready event received: " + event.getFileName());
        downloadFile(event.getFileName());
        return "File download started";
    }

    private void downloadFile(String fileName) {
        System.out.println("Downloading file: " + fileName);
        // Add logic to download file from vendor's location
    }

    static class VendorFileEvent {
        private String fileName;
        public String getFileName() { return fileName; }
        public void setFileName(String fileName) { this.fileName = fileName; }
    }
}
ðŸ”¹ Why Use This?
âœ… Real-time notification
âœ… No need for constant polling
âœ… Efficient for cloud APIs

## ðŸ”¹ Approach 3: Kafka Event Streaming (Best for Enterprise Systems)
If the vendor publishes file availability events via Kafka, you can consume the event and start downloading the file.

âœ… Steps
Vendor publishes a Kafka message with file details.
Your Spring Boot app listens to Kafka topic and downloads the file.
ðŸ“Œ Implementation (Kafka Consumer for File Events)
java
Copy
Edit
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecord;
import org.springframework.kafka.annotation.KafkaListener;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class FileEventConsumer {

    @KafkaListener(topics = "vendor-file-events", groupId = "vendor-group")
    public void consumeFileEvent(ConsumerRecord<String, String> record) {
        System.out.println("File ready event received: " + record.value());
        downloadFile(record.value());
    }

    private void downloadFile(String filePath) {
        System.out.println("Downloading file: " + filePath);
        // File download logic
    }
}
ðŸ”¹ Why Use This?
âœ… Real-time file tracking
âœ… Scales well in microservices
âœ… Decouples vendor system from your system

## ðŸ”¹ Approach 4: Checking for a Ready Flag File (Used for Batch Processing)
If the vendor drops files in a location, they may provide a flag file (e.g., .done, .ready) when the file is fully uploaded.

âœ… Steps
Wait for file.ready or file.done to appear.
Once detected, download the corresponding file.
ðŸ“Œ Implementation (Using Java Polling)

import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.*;

public class ReadyFileWatcher {

    private static final String VENDOR_DIRECTORY = "/vendor/files/";
    private static final String LOCAL_DIRECTORY = "/local/vendor/files/";

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        watchDirectory(VENDOR_DIRECTORY);
    }

    public static void watchDirectory(String dirPath) {
        Path path = Paths.get(dirPath);

        try (WatchService watchService = FileSystems.getDefault().newWatchService()) {
            path.register(watchService, StandardWatchEventKinds.ENTRY_CREATE);

            while (true) {
                WatchKey key = watchService.take();
                for (WatchEvent<?> event : key.pollEvents()) {
                    Path filePath = ((WatchEvent<Path>) event).context();
                    if (filePath.toString().endsWith(".ready")) {
                        String fileName = filePath.toString().replace(".ready", "");
                        System.out.println("File is ready: " + fileName);
                        downloadFile(fileName);
                    }
                }
                key.reset();
            }

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    private static void downloadFile(String fileName) {
        System.out.println("Downloading file: " + fileName);
        // Add logic to download file
    }
}
ðŸ”¹ Why Use This?
âœ… Works well for batch-based vendor systems
âœ… Ensures files are fully uploaded before downloading

ðŸŽ¯ Which One Should You Choose?
Approach	Best For	Pros	Cons
Polling (Scheduled Check)	Vendors with no notifications	Simple, works with FTP/SFTP/HDFS	Not real-time
Webhook Notification	API-based vendor services	Real-time, efficient	Vendor must support webhooks
Kafka Event Streaming	Event-driven vendors	Scalable, real-time	Requires Kafka setup
Ready Flag File	Batch file uploads	Ensures file completion	Requires vendor cooperation
ðŸš€ Recommended Approach for Your Vendor File Processing System
If vendor provides an API notification â†’ Use Webhook
If vendor supports Kafka â†’ Use Kafka Event Processing
If no real-time notification is available â†’ Use Polling Mechanism
If vendor drops a flag file â†’ Use File Watcher




Level 0: Raw File Processing with Spark

Example Spark Job for Level 0:
java
Copy
Edit
import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession;
import org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset;
import org.apache.spark.sql.Row;

public class Level0Processing {

                .getOrCreate();

        // Load raw .txt file into Spark
        String rawFilePath = "/nfs/raw_data/raw_file.txt";
        Dataset<Row> rawData = spark.read().text(rawFilePath);

        // Process or validate the raw file (e.g., check for empty lines, malformed data, etc.)
        Dataset<Row> validatedData = rawData.filter("length(value) > 0");

        // Write validated data to NFS in a structured format
        String level0OutputPath = "/nfs/processed_data/level0/";
        validatedData.write().parquet(level0OutputPath);

        // Stop Spark session
        spark.stop();
    }
}
Level 1: Cleansing and Parquet Conversion with Spark

                .getOrCreate();

        // Load validated data from Level 0 (stored as Parquet)
        String level0DataPath = "/nfs/processed_data/level0/";
        Dataset<Row> dataFromLevel0 = spark.read().parquet(level0DataPath);

        // Perform cleansing and transformations (e.g., remove duplicates, handle missing data)
        Dataset<Row> cleansedData = dataFromLevel0.dropDuplicates();

        // Write the cleansed data back to NFS in Parquet format
        String level1OutputPath = "/nfs/processed_data/level1/";
        cleansedData.write().parquet(level1OutputPath);

        // Stop Spark session
        spark.stop();
    }
}

        // Load cleansed data from Level 1
        String level1DataPath = "/nfs/processed_data/level1/";
        Dataset<Row> dataFromLevel1 = spark.read().parquet(level1DataPath);

        // Apply business logic (e.g., calculate new columns, enrich data)
        Dataset<Row> finalData = dataFromLevel1.withColumn("new_column", functions.lit("processed"));

        // Write the final data to NFS in Parquet format
        String finalOutputPath = "/nfs/processed_data/final/";
        finalData.write().parquet(finalOutputPath);

        // Stop Spark session
        spark.stop();
    }
}






## Kafka Integration (Event Triggering)
At each level, after the processing is done, you can trigger a Kafka event to signal the completion of the task and move on to the next level.

For example, after Level 0 processing:


// After processing, publish a Kafka event to trigger Level 1
kafkaTemplate.send("level0_complete", "fileName.parquet");
Summary Workflow
Level 0 (Raw File Processing):

Load the raw .txt file using Spark.
Perform validation/initial checks.
Store processed data in Parquet format in NFS.
Level 1 (Cleansing and Parquet Conversion):

Load the Parquet file from Level 0.
Cleanse the data (e.g., drop duplicates, handle missing values).
Convert it to a new Parquet file and store it in NFS.
Level 2 (Business Logic and Final Parquet Generation):

Apply business logic on the cleansed Parquet data.
Generate the final Parquet file and store it in NFS.
Kafka Event-Driven Pipeline:

After each level of processing, a Kafka event is published to signal the completion of that stage, triggering the next stage.
This architecture should provide a scalable, efficient, and event-driven pipeline for your vendor file processing system.

Would you like any more detailed guidance on setting up Kafka consumers, deployment pipelines, or Spark configurations?







You said:
How is this architecture scalable
ChatGPT said:
The architecture you've designed for the vendor file processing system is highly scalable due to several key elements:

1. Distributed Processing with Apache Spark
Horizontal Scaling: Spark can scale across many nodes in a cluster, enabling you to process large datasets in parallel. As your data grows, you can add more Spark workers to the cluster to handle increased workloads.
Efficient Data Processing: By using distributed in-memory computation, Spark is optimized for fast data processing. It allows for processing large files (like your raw .txt files) in a highly efficient manner.
Data Partitioning: Spark supports data partitioning, meaning it can split datasets across multiple nodes to process them in parallel, increasing throughput and performance.
2. Kafka for Event-Driven Architecture
Asynchronous Processing: Kafka enables asynchronous communication between the different stages of your pipeline. This means each level can process data independently and trigger events when they are done. It decouples the stages and prevents bottlenecks, ensuring that the system can handle high throughput.
Scalable Event Handling: Kafka is designed to handle high volumes of events and messages. By adding more Kafka brokers, you can horizontally scale your messaging infrastructure to handle increased load without significant performance degradation.
Consumer Parallelism: Kafka consumers can be scaled out to multiple instances, allowing you to process events in parallel. For instance, you can have multiple consumers for the download_ready or level0_complete events, ensuring fast processing.
3. Storage in NFS
Shared Storage: Using NFS ensures that all nodes (e.g., Spark workers) can access the same data, making it easy to scale the system without worrying about managing data replication or synchronization across different nodes.
Storage Scaling: As your dataset grows, you can scale the NFS storage capacity to store larger files, and it's easy to expand the storage without affecting the core processing logic.
4. Kafka-Driven Pipeline for Flexibility and Extensibility
Event Triggering Between Stages: The use of Kafka events between stages (Level 0, Level 1, Level 2) allows you to scale each stage independently. Each stage can be processed as an independent microservice or worker, and you can scale them up based on demand.
Loose Coupling of Components: With Kafka, each part of the pipeline (file checking, downloading, processing, etc.) can work independently and be scaled separately. This loose coupling allows for easier scaling, maintenance, and updates without affecting other parts of the system.
5. Sparkâ€™s Parquet File Storage for Efficiency
Efficient File Format: Parquet is a columnar file format that is optimized for reading large datasets efficiently. By converting your raw data to Parquet format at each level, you improve I/O performance and compression, reducing the amount of storage needed and the time required to process the data.
Compatibility with Big Data Tools: Parquet files are compatible with various big data tools and platforms, which allows you to integrate other systems (like Hadoop or more Spark clusters) if needed, making it easier to scale your system for future use cases.
6. Scalability of Each Level
Level 0 (File Checking/Downloading): This level involves checking for the file and downloading it. As you scale, you can introduce multiple downloaders (Kafka consumers) to handle more files concurrently.
Level 1 (Cleansing and Conversion): With Spark, you can scale this processing step by running multiple jobs across different worker nodes. As data grows, Spark can distribute the cleansing process over more nodes.
Level 2 (Business Logic/Final Processing): Similarly, in the final processing stage, you can scale out by running multiple Spark jobs, each handling different parts of the data or running concurrently.
7. Microservices and Independent Scaling
Microservice Architecture: If your pipeline is built using microservices, each stage (file checking, downloading, Level 0, Level 1, Level 2) can be deployed as a separate microservice that can be scaled independently based on the load.
Auto-scaling with Kubernetes: If you're deploying the system on Kubernetes (K8s), you can use Kubernetes' auto-scaling capabilities to scale up/down the number of pods (instances) of each microservice based on the number of events in Kafka, the file load, or the amount of data being processed.
8. Horizontal Scaling for Spark
Scale Spark Cluster: You can increase the size of your Spark cluster as your data grows. This means more nodes can join the cluster, allowing you to process larger datasets more efficiently and quickly.
Dynamic Resource Allocation: Spark can dynamically allocate resources (memory, CPU) based on the workload, making it easy to scale processing efficiently.
9. Fault Tolerance and Reliability
Spark Fault Tolerance: Spark provides built-in fault tolerance by replicating data across nodes in the cluster. If a node fails, Spark can recover the lost data from other nodes, ensuring the system continues to run smoothly.
Kafkaâ€™s Durability: Kafka ensures that messages (events) are durable and can be reprocessed if necessary, so even if a stage fails, you can re-trigger the processing without losing data.
How Scalability Works Together:
Parallelism in both Kafka (events) and Spark (data processing) ensures that as the volume of files increases, your system can handle more tasks concurrently.
The decoupling between the stages and the use of Kafka enables each stage to scale independently, ensuring that heavy traffic or processing at one level does not slow down the others.
As the system grows, you can horizontally scale both the Kafka brokers and Spark workers to meet increasing demand, ensuring the system remains responsive and efficient.
Future Scalability Considerations:
If your data volume grows significantly or your use cases expand (e.g., adding more vendors), you can introduce additional Kafka topics or Spark clusters to manage the increased load.
With cloud infrastructure, you can take advantage of on-demand scaling for both Kafka and Spark, ensuring cost-efficiency and resource optimization.
Would you like more detailed examples on any specific aspect of scaling, or guidance on setting up these components in a cloud environment like AWS or Azure?
